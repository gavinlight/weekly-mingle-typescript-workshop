# Weekly mingle TypeScript workshop
Small introductionary workshop on how we do TypeScript at Label A, and how you can start using it in your projects.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Clone the project and run `npm install` to install the packages.

## Instructions
Every exercise has its own folder in `src/exercises`. To start an exercise run `npm run test-X`. If no errors are left in your terminal you finished the exercise. Afterwards we'll go over the solutions together.
